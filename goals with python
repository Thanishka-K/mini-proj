In order to learn the ml concepts, the plan is to learn python:

Phase 1: Foundations (Day 1–3)
Day 1: Python for Data Science
Learn NumPy (arrays and math) and Pandas (loading CSVs, filtering data).
Goal: Load a dataset and calculate basic statistics (mean, median).

Day 2: Data Visualization
Learn Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Goal: Create histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps to "see" data.

Day 3: The Math "Cheat Sheet"
Brush up on Linear Algebra (matrix multiplication) and Calculus (the concept of Gradient Descent).
Goal: Understand how a computer "steps" toward the right answer.
